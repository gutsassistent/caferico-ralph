### RD-032: Animations - Page Transitions & Scroll Effects ✅
- All acceptance criteria were already fulfilled by previous iterations:
  - PageTransition.tsx: fade-in on route change (animate-fadeIn, 400ms ease-out)
  - Reveal.tsx: IntersectionObserver scroll-triggered fade-in-up (700ms, threshold 0.05)
  - HeroParallax.tsx: rAF-based parallax at 0.15x speed, will-change-transform
  - ParallaxOrb.tsx: reusable parallax with configurable speed (0.08 default)
  - Hover animations on product cards (lift, zoom, shadow) across shop and homepage
  - Button hover states with scale/color transitions throughout
  - globals.css: smooth scroll behavior (scroll-behavior: smooth)
  - All components respect prefers-reduced-motion (motion-reduce classes, media queries)
  - ScrollToTop.tsx: floating button after 400px scroll with fade transition
  - Toast.tsx: slide-up + fade-in notifications (animate-toast-in)
  - All scroll listeners use rAF and { passive: true } for 60fps performance
- No code changes needed — story was effectively completed across RD-004, RD-007, RD-008, RD-031

- Added `cartBounce` keyframe to tailwind.config.ts: scale 1→1.35→0.9→1 over 400ms

- Updated ScrollToTop threshold from 400px to 500px per AC
- Existing micro-interactions already in place: button hover states (color transitions), link underline animations (Header nav), custom checkboxes (ShopCatalog), form focus states (border-gold), hamburger→X animation, filter accordion, toast component with auto-dismiss
