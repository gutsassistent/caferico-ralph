      },
      "coffeeTwo": {
        "question": "What is the difference between light, medium, and dark roast?",
        "answer": "Light roast preserves fruity and floral origin notes, medium brings balance between origin character and caramel sweetness, and dark roast delivers a full body with chocolate and nutty tones. Filter and pour-over work best with light to medium, espresso with medium to dark."
      },
      "coffeeThree": {
        "question": "Is Honduras a coffee country?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Coffee accounts for over 3% of Honduras's GDP and 30% of agricultural production. It is the country's most important export product. Our coffee grows in the Marcala region at 1,350–1,850 metres altitude."
      },
      "coffeeFour": {
        "question": "What is a Q-grader?",

      },
      "coffeeFive": {
        "question": "How is organic coffee decaffeinated?",
        "answer": "Our decaf is 100% naturally decaffeinated using the CO2 method. This process takes place in Germany and uses no chemicals — only carbon dioxide under high pressure. This preserves the full flavour."
      },
      "ordersOne": {
        "question": "How fast is my order dispatched?",
        "answer": "Orders placed before 12:00 are roasted and shipped the same day."
      },
      "ordersTwo": {
        "question": "Can I change my order after placing it?",
        "answer": "Updates are possible within two hours before it enters production."

        "question": "How do I track my order?",
